#### What is HTTP

* HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
* The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser.
* HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which forms the foundation of the internet.

<br>

**TCP/IP** - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

#### Features of HTTP

There are three basic features of HTTP 

* **HTTP is connectionless** : The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.
* **HTTP is media independent**: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.
* **HTTP is stateless:** As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.

#### HTTP Architecture

The following diagram shows a very basic architecture of a web application and depicts where HTTP sits:

![image architecture](/images-http/Architecture.png)<!-- width="250px" height="300px" -->

The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.

Client
The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a TCP/IP connection.

Server
The HTTP server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta information, and possible entity-body content.

#### Advantages of HTTP

1. **Addressing**: HTTP uses advanced scheme of addressing. It assigns IP address with recognizable names so that it can be identified easily in the World Wide Web. Compared to the standard procedure of IP address with a series of numbers, using this the public can easily engage with the internet.

2. **Flexibility** : Whenever there are additional capabilities needed by an application, HTTP has the capability to download extensions or plugins and display the relevant data. These can include Flash players and Acrobat reader.

3. **Security** : In HTTP each files is downloaded from an independent connection and then gets closed. Due to this no more than one single element of a webpage gets transferred. Therefore, the chance of interception during transmission is minimized here. 
 

4. **Latency** : Only when the connection is established, the handshaking process will take place in HTTP. Hence, there will be no handshaking procedure following a request. This significantly reduces latency in the connection. 

5. **Accessibility** : When the page is loaded for the first time, all of the HTTP pages gets stored inside the internet caches known as the page cache. Therefore, once the page is visited again, the content is loaded quickly.

#### Disadvantages of HTTP

1. **Data Integrity** : Since there are no any encryption methods used in HTTP, there are chances of someone altering the content. That is the reason why HTTP is considered to be an insecure method prone to data integrity.
2. **Data Privacy** : Privacy is another problem faced in a HTTP connection. If any hacker manages to intercept the request they can view all the content present in the web page. Besides that they can also gather confidential informations such as the username and the password.

3. **Server Availability** : Even if HTTP receives all the data that it needs, clients does not take measures to close the connection. Therefore, during this time period, server will not be present. 

4. **Administrative Overhead** : For transmitting a web page, a HTTP needs to create multiple connections. This causes administrative overhead in the connection. 

5. **IoT Device Support** : HTTP uses more number of system resources which leads to more power consumption. Since IoT device today contain wireless sensor networks, it is not suitable to use HTTP. 

## HTTP Parameters

In this section, we will discuss various HTTP parameters and their syntax. For example, date and time format, character set, etc. These parameters are used in the construction of our request and response message while writing the HTTP program of the client or server.

The various parameters of HTTP are as follows:

* [**HTTP Version**](#http-version)
* [**Uniform Resource Identifiers**](#uniform-resource-identifiers)
* [**Date/Time Formats**](#date-or-time-formats)
* [**Character Sets**](#character-sets)
* [**Content Encodings**](#content-encodings)
* [**Media Types**](#media-types)
* [**Language Tags**](#language-tags)

#### HTTP Version

HTTP uses a **<major>**.**<minor>** numbering scheme to indicate versions of the protocol. The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field in the first line.

Syntax:

```markdown
HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
```

Example:

```markdown
HTTP/1.0

or

HTTP/1.1
```

#### Uniform Resource Identifiers

Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) are simply formatted, case-insensitive string containing name, location, etc. to identify a resource, for example, a website, a web service, etc.

Syntax:

```markdown
URI = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
```

* "http" scheme is used to locate network resources through the HTTP protocol.
* Here if the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed for HTTP and an empty abs path is equivalent to an abs_path of "/". The characters other than those in the reserved and unsafe sets are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.

Example:

```markdown
http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html
http://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html
http://ABC.com:/%7esmith/home.html
```

#### Date or Time Formats

* All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception.
* HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:

```markdown
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
```

#### Character Sets

We use character sets to specify the character sets that the client prefers. Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas. If a value is not specified, the default is the US-ASCII

Example:

Following are the valid character sets:

```markdown
US-ASCII

or

ISO-8859-1

or 

ISO-8859-7
```

#### Content Encodings

A content encoding value indicates that an encoding algorithm has been used to encode the content before passing it over the network. Content coding are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed without losing the identity.

All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding header fields which we will see in the subsequent chapters.

Example:

Following are the valid encoding schemes

```markdown
Accept-encoding: gzip

or

Accept-encoding: compress

or 

Accept-encoding: deflate
```

#### Media Types

HTTP uses Internet Media Types in the Content-Type and Accept header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation. All the Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA).

The general syntax to specify media type is as follows:

```markdown
media-type     = type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )
```

The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case--insensitive.

Example:

```markdown
Accept: image/gif
```

#### Language Tags

HTTP uses language tags within the Accept-Language and Content-Language fields. A language tag is composed of one or more parts: a primary language tag and a possibly empty series of subtags:

```markdown
language-tag  = primary-tag *( "-" subtag )
```

White spaces are not allowed within the tag and all tags are case- insensitive.

Example:

```markdown
en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin
```

## Working of Web

The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client and server send back HTTP response message to browser. 

This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

![image working-of-web](/images-http/working-of-web.png)

## HTTP Messages 

HTTP Message is used to show how data is exchanged between the client and the server. It is based on client-server architecture. An HTTP client is a program that establishes a connection to a server to send one or more HTTP request messages. An HTTP server is a program that accepts connections to serve HTTP requests by sending an HTTP response messages.

The HTTP Messages can be classified as follows:

* [**Message Type**](#media-types)
* [**Message Headers**](#message-headers)
* [**Message Body**](#message-body)
* [**Message Length**](#message-length)
* [**General Header Fields**](#general-header-fields)

#### Message Type

HTTP message consists of an initial request line and an initial response line.

Format:

```markdown
HTTP-message = Request | Response ; HTTP/1.1 messages  
```

**Initial Request Line**

The initial line is different for the request and for the response. A request-line consists of three parts: a method name, requested resource's local path, and the HTTP version being used. All these parts are separated by spaces.

Syntax:

```markdown
GET /path/to/file/index.html HTTP/1.0 
```

* GET is the most common HTTP method.
* The path shows the part of the URL after the host name. It is also called a request URI.
* The version of HTTP always takes the form “HTTP/x.x”, uppercase.

![image request](/images-http/http-message1.png)

**Initial Response Line**

The initial Response line is also known as the status line. It also has three parts: the HTTP version, a response status code that gives the result of the request, and the English reason phrase describing the status code.

```markdown
HTTP/1.0 200 OK  
or  
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
```  

![image request](/images-http/http-message2.png)

#### Message Headers

The Message header provides information about the request and response. It also provides information about the object which is sent in the message body. Message Headers are of four types:

* **General Header**: It has general applicability for both request messages and response messages.
* **Request Header**: It has applicability only for the request messages.
* **Response Header**: It has applicability only for the response messages.
* **Entity Header**: It defines meta-information about the entity-body, and about the resource identified by request.

All the above headers follow the same generic format. Each of the header fields consists of a name followed by a colon and the field values as follows:

```markdown
message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]  
```

#### Message Body

The message body of an HTTP message is used to carry the entire body associated with the request and response. The message-body differs from the entire-body only when a transfer-coding has been applied, as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding header field.

Syntax

```markdown
message-body = entity-body  
        | <entity-body encoded as per Transfer-Encoding> 
``` 

Transfer-Encoding MUST be used to indicate any transfer-codings which is applied by an application to ensure safe and proper transfer of the message. Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message.

#### Message Length

The transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body, and it appears in the message.

In a message, when a message body is allowed, and Content-Length is given, its field value MUST exactly match the number of OCTETs in the message-body. When an invalid length is received and detected, the HTTP/1.1 user agents MUST notify the user.

#### General Header Fields

Some header fields have the applicability for both the request and response messages. These header fields apply only when the message is transmitted.

Syntax

```markdown
general-header = Cache-Control 
``` 

## HTTP Request

An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:

> * A Request Line
> * Zero or more header(General,Request,Entity) fields followed by CRLF
> * An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields
> * Optionally a message-body

**Syntax**

```markdown
Request  = Request-Line                
        *(( general-header        
        | request-header           
        | entity-header ) CRLF)    
        CRLF  
        [ message-body ] 
``` 

* [**Request Line**](#request-line)
* [**Request Method**](#request-method)
* [**Request-URI**](#request-uri)
* [**Request Header Fields**](#request-header-fields)
* [**Examples**](#http-request-examples)

#### Request Line

The Request-Line starts with a method token, which is followed by the Request-URI, the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. Using the SP characters, the elements are separated.

**Syntax**

```markdown
Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF 
``` 

#### Request Method

The request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive and should always be mentioned in uppercase. The following table lists all the supported methods in HTTP/1.1.

| **_Sl No_** | **_Method_** | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | GET          | The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data. |
| 2           | HEAD         | Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only.                                                                                                        |
| 3           | POST         | A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.                                                         |
| 4           | PUT          | Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.                                                                                        |
| 5           | DELETE       | Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.                                                                                                      |
| 6           | CONNECT      | Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.                                                                                                                     |
| 7           | OPTIONS      | Describe the communication options for the target resource.                                                                                                                       |
| 8           | TRACE        | Performs a message loop back test along with the path to the target resource.                                                                                                     |

#### Request URI

The Request-URI is a **Uniform Resource Identifier** and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request. Following are the most commonly used forms to specify an URI:

```markdown
Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
```

| **_Method_**  | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| asterisk "*"  | The asterisk star is used to show that the request does not apply to a particular resource, but it will apply to the server itself. It is allowed only when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. Example: OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 |
| absoluteURI   | The absoluteURI form is used only when the request is being made to a proxy. The requested proxy is used to forward the request and return the response. Example : GET http://swayaan.com/ HTTP/1.1                                               |
| absolute path | The absolute path can't be empty. If in the original URI, none is present, it must be given as "/"                                                                                                                                                |
| authority     | The authority form is only used by the CONNECT method.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Request Header Fields

This request-header field allows the client to pass additional information to the server, including the request and the client.The request header fields function as request modifiers, with semantics similar to the parameters of a method invocation in a programming language.

Syntax

```markdown
request-header = Accept                     
                      | Accept-Charset            
                      | Accept-Encoding            
                      | Accept-Language            
                      | Authorization              
                      | Expect                    
                      | From                       
                      | Host                      
                      | If-Match                   
                      | If-Modified-Since        
                      | If-None-Match             
                      | If-Range                
                      | If-Unmodified-Since       
                      | Max-Forwards              
                      | Proxy-Authorization       
                      | Range                     
                      | Referer                   
                      | TE                        
                      | User-Agent  
```

#### HTTP Request Examples

Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP request to fetch hello.htm page from the web

```markdown
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

## HTTP Responses

After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message

> * A Status-line
> * Zero or more header (General,Response,Entity) fields followed by CRLF
> * An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields
> * Optionally a message-body

An HTTP response contains the following things:

* [**Status Line**](#message-status-line)
* [**Response Header Fields or a series of HTTP headers**](#response-header-fields)
* [**Examples**](#http-response-examples)

#### Message Status-Line

A Status-Line consists of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase. The elements are separated by space SP characters.

```markdown
Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
```

**HTTP Version**

A server supporting HTTP version 1.1 will return the following version information:

```markdown
HTTP-Version = HTTP/1.1
```

**Status Code**

The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer where first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:

| **_Sl No_** | **_Code_**         | **_Description_**                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1           | 1xx: Informational | It means the request was received and the process is continuing.         |
| 2           | 2xx: Success       | It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted. |
| 3           | 3xx: Redirection   | It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.  |
| 4           | 4xx: Client Error  | It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.   |
| 5           | 5xx: Server Error  | It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.       |

#### Response Header Fields

The HTTP Headers for the response of the server contain the information that a client can use to find out more about the response, and about the server that sent it. This information is used to assist the client with displaying the response to a user, with storing the response for the use of future, and with making further requests to the server now or in the future.

```markdown
response-header = Accept-Ranges            
                  | Age                     
                  | ETag                     
                  | Location                
                  | Proxy-Authenticate       
                  | Retry-After              
                  | Server             
                  | Vary                    
                  | WWW-Authenticate     
```

#### HTTP Response Examples

Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP response for a request to fetch the hello.htm page from the web server

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The following example shows an HTTP response message displaying error condition when the web server could not find the requested page

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2012 10:36:20 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-Length: 230
Connection: Closed
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

```htm
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html>
<head>
   <title>404 Not Found</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Not Found</h1>
   <p>The requested URL /t.html was not found on this server.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## HTTP Methods

For HTTP/1.1, the set of common methods are defined below. This set can be expanded based on the requirements. The name of these methods is case sensitive, and they must be used in uppercase.

| **_Method_**                   | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**GET**](#get-method)         | The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data. |
| [**HEAD**](#head-method)       | Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only.                                                                                                        |
| [**POST**](#post-method)       | A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.                                                         |
| [**PUT**](#put-method)         | Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.                                                                                        |
| [**DELETE**](#delete-method)   | Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.                                                                                                      |
| [**CONNECT**](#connect-method) | Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.                                                                                                                     |
| [**OPTIONS**](#options-method) | Describe the communication options for the target resource.                                                                                                                       |
| [**TRACE**](#trace-method)     | Performs a message loop back test along with the path to the target resource.                                                                                                     |

#### GET Method

A GET request retrieves data from a web server by specifying parameters in the URL portion of the request. This is the main method used for document retrieval. The following example makes use of GET method to fetch hello.htm:

```markdown
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

The server response against the above GET request will be as follows:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### HEAD Method

The HEAD method is functionally similar to GET, except that the server replies with a response line and headers, but no entity-body. The following example makes use of HEAD method to fetch header information about hello.htm:

```markdown
HEAD /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

The server response against the above HEAD request will be as follows:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
```

You can notice that here server the does not send any data after header.

#### POST Method

The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example, file update, form data, etc. The following example makes use of POST method to send a form data to the server, which will be processed by a process.cgi and finally a response will be returned:

```markdown
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 88
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

```htm
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<string xmlns="http://clearforest.com/">string</string>
```

The server side script process.cgi processes the passed data and sends the following response:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<html>
<body>
<h1>Request Processed Successfully</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### PUT Method

The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL. The following example requests the server to save the given entity-body in hello.htm at the root of the server:

```markdown
PUT /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: 182
```

```htm
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The server will store the given entity-body in hello.htm file and will send the following response back to the client:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 30
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<html>
<body>
<h1>The file was created.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### DELETE Method

The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete a file at a location specified by the given URL. The following example requests the server to delete the given file hello.htm at the root of the server:

```markdown
DELETE /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

The server will delete the mentioned file hello.htm and will send the following response back to the client:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 30
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<html>
<body>
<h1>URL deleted.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### CONNECT Method

The CONNECT method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP. The following example requests a connection with a web server

```markdown
CONNECT www.tutorialspoint.com HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

The connection is established with the server and the following response is sent back to the client:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
```

#### OPTIONS Method

The OPTIONS method is used by the client to find out the HTTP methods and other options supported by a web server. The client can specify a URL for the OPTIONS method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. The following example requests a list of methods supported by a web server running on tutorialspoint.com:

```markdown
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

The server will send an information based on the current configuration of the server, for example:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Allow: GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS,TRACE
Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory
```

#### TRACE Method

The TRACE method is used to echo the contents of an HTTP Request back to the requester which can be used for debugging purpose at the time of development. The following example shows the usage of TRACE method:

```markdown
TRACE / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

The server will send the following message in response to the above request:

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Connection: close
Content-Type: message/http
Content-Length: 39

TRACE / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

## HTTP Status Codes

The Status-Code element in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit

| **_Code_**                                 | **_Description_**                                                        |

| 406 Not Acceptable                  | The server can only generate a response that is not accepted by the client.                                                                                      |
| 407 Proxy Authentication Required   | You must authenticate with a proxy server before this request can be served.                                                                                     |
| 408 Request Timeout                 | The request took longer than the server was prepared to wait.                                                                                                    |

## HTTP Header Fields

HTTP header fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are four types of HTTP message headers:

* [**General-header**](#general-headers): These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.
* [**Client Request-header**](#client-request-header): These header fields have applicability only for request messages.
* [**Server Response-header**](#server-response-headers): These header fields have applicability only for response messages.
* [**Entity-header**](#entity-headers): These header fields define meta information about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.

#### General Headers

**Cache-Control**

The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all the caching system. The syntax is as follows:

```markdown
Cache-Control : cache-request-directive|cache-response-directive
```

An HTTP client or server can use the Cache-control general header to specify parameters for the cache or to request certain kinds of documents from the cache. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:

```markdown
Cache-control: no-cache
```

The following table lists the important cache request directives that can be used by the client in its HTTP request

| **_Cache Request Directive_** | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no-cache                      | A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server.                                             |
| no-store                      | The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.                                                                                      |
| max-age = seconds             | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.                                                |
| max-stale [ = seconds ]       | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time. If seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time. |
| min-fresh = seconds           | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is not less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.               |
| no-transform                  | Does not convert the entity-body.                                                                                                                                     |
| only-if-cached                | Does not retrieve new data. The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.         |

The following important cache response directives that can be used by the server in its HTTP response

| **_Cache Response Directive_** | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public                         | Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.                                                                                                                                             |
| private                        | Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache                                                                           |
| no-cache                       | A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful re-validation with the origin server.                                                                          |
| no-store                       | The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.                                                                                                                    |
| no-transform                   | Does not convert the entity-body.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| must-revalidate                | The cache must verify the status of the stale documents before using it and expired ones should not be used.                                                                                        |
| proxy-revalidate               | The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.                                               |
| max-age = seconds              | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.                                                                              |
| s-maxage = seconds             | The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache. |

**Connection**

The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and must not be communicated by proxies over further connections. Following is the simple syntax for using connection header:

```markdown
Connection : "Connection"
```

HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example:

```markdown
Connection: close
```

By default, HTTP 1.1 uses persistent connections, where the connection does not automatically close after a transaction. HTTP 1.0, on the other hand, does not have persistent connections by default. If a 1.0 client wishes to use persistent connections, it uses the keep-alive parameter as follows:

```markdown
Connection: keep-alive
```

**Date**

All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:

```markdown
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
Here the first format is the most preferred one.
```

**Pragma**

The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain. For example:

```markdown
Pragma: no-cache
```

The only directive defined in HTTP/1.0 is the no-cache directive and is maintained in HTTP 1.1 for backward compatibility. No new Pragma directives will be defined in the future.

**Trailer**

The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding. Following is the syntax of Trailer header field:

```markdown
Trailer : field-name
```

Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field must not include the following header fields:

* Transfer-Encoding
* Content-Length
* Trailer

**Transfer-Encoding**

The Transfer-Encoding general-header field indicates what type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This is not the same as content-encoding because transfer-encodings are a property of the message, not of the entity-body. The syntax of Transfer-Encoding header field is as follows:

```markdown
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.

**Upgrade**

The Upgrade general-header allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. For example:

```markdown
Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
```

The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.

**Via**

The Via general-header must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients. For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu. The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field:

```markdown
Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)
```

The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.

**Warning**

The Warning general-header is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. A response may carry more than one Warning header.

```markdown
Warning : warn-code SP warn-agent SP warn-text SP warn-date
```

#### Client Request-header

* **Accept**

The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. The general syntax is as follows:

```markdown
Accept: type/subtype [q=qvalue]
```

Multiple media types can be listed separated by commas and the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for accept types on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:

```markdown
Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html, text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c
```

This would be interpreted as text/html and text/x-c and are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the text/x-dvi entity, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain entity.

* **Accept-Charset**

The Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:

```markdown
Accept-Charset: character_set [q=qvalue]
```

Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas and the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred character sets on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:

```markdown
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1; q=0.8
```

The special value "*", if present in the Accept-Charset field, matches every character set and if no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable.

* **Accept-Encoding**

The Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Accept-Encoding: encoding types
```

Examples are as follows:

```markdown
Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
Accept-Encoding:
Accept-Encoding: *
Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0
```

* **Accept-Language**

The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Accept-Language: language [q=qvalue]
```

Multiple languages can be listed separated by commas and the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for non preferred languages on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:

```markdown
Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7
```

* **Authorization**

The Authorization request-header field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Authorization : credentials
```

The HTTP/1.0 specification defines the BASIC authorization scheme, where the authorization parameter is the string of username:password encoded in base 64. Following is an example:

```markdown
Authorization: BASIC Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3QxMjM=
```

The value decodes into is guest:guest123 where guest is user ID and guest123 is the password.

* **Cookie**

The Cookie request-header field value contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL. Following is the general syntax:

```markdown
Cookie: name=value
```

Multiple cookies can be specified separated by semicolons as follows:

```markdown
Cookie: name1=value1;name2=value2;name3=value3
```

* **Expect**

The Expect request-header field is used to indicate that a particular set of server behaviors is required by the client. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Expect : 100-continue | expectation-extension
```

If a server receives a request containing an Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not support, it must respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.

* **From**

The From request-header field contains an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. Following is a simple example:

```markdown
From: webmaster@w3.org
```

This header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests.

* **Host**

The Host request-header field is used to specify the Internet host and the port number of the resource being requested. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Host : "Host" ":" host [ ":" port ] ;
```

A host without any trailing port information implies the default port, which is 80. For example, a request on the origin server for http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/ would be:

```markdown
GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.w3.org
```

* **If-Match**

The If-Match request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by ETag. The general syntax is:

```markdown
If-Match : entity-tag
```

An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity exists. Following are possible examples:

```markdown
If-Match: "xyzzy"
If-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-Match: *
```

If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.

* **If-Modified-Since**

The If-Modified-Since request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested URL has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body. The general syntax of if-modified-since is:

```markdown
If-Modified-Since : HTTP-date
```
An example of the field is:

```markdown
If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
```

If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.

* **If-None-Match**

The If-None-Match request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if one of the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by ETag. The general syntax is:

```markdown
If-None-Match : entity-tag
```

An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity does not exist. Following are the possible examples:

```markdown
If-None-Match: "xyzzy"
If-None-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-None-Match: *
```

* **If-Range**

The If-Range request-header field can be used with a conditional GET to request only the portion of the entity that is missing, if it has not been changed, and the entire entity if it has been changed. The general syntax is as follows:

```markdown
If-Range : entity-tag | HTTP-date
```

Either an entity tag or a date can be used to identify the partial entity already received. For example:

```markdown
If-Range: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
```

Here if the document has not been modified since the given date, the server returns the byte range given by the Range header, otherwise it returns all of the new document.

* **If-Unmodified-Since**

The If-Unmodified-Since request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. The general syntax is:

```markdown
If-Unmodified-Since : HTTP-date
```

If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server should perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present. For example:

```markdown
If-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
```

If the request results in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, the If-Unmodified-Since header should be ignored.

* **Max-Forwards**

The Max-Forwards request-header field provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. Here is the general syntax:

```markdown
Max-Forwards : n
```

The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining number of times this request message may be forwarded. This is useful for debugging with the TRACE method, avoiding infinite loops. For example:

```markdown
Max-Forwards : 5
```

The Max-Forwards header field may be ignored for all other methods defined in the HTTP specification.

* **Proxy-Authorization**

The Proxy-Authorization request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication. Here is the general syntax:

```markdown
Proxy-Authorization : credentials
```

The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.

* **Range**

The Range request-header field specifies the partial range(s) of the content requested from the document. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Range: bytes-unit=first-byte-pos "-" [last-byte-pos]
```

The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte positions specified are inclusive. You can specify a byte-unit as bytes. Byte offsets start at zero. Some simple examples are as follows:

```markdown
- The first 500 bytes 
Range: bytes=0-499

- The second 500 bytes
Range: bytes=500-999

- The final 500 bytes
Range: bytes=-500

- The first and last bytes only
Range: bytes=0-0,-1
```

Multiple ranges can be listed, separated by commas. If the first digit in the comma-separated byte range(s) is missing, the range is assumed to count from the end of the document. If the second digit is missing, the range is byte n to the end of the document.

* **Referer**

The Referer request-header field allows the client to specify the address (URI) of the resource from which the URL has been requested. The general syntax is as follows:

```markdown
Referer : absoluteURI | relativeURI
```

Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Referer: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
```

If the field value is a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the Request-URI.

* **TE**

The TE request-header field indicates what extension transfer-coding it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding. Following is the general syntax:

```markdown
TE   : t-codings
```

The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding and it is specified either of the ways:

```markdown
TE: deflate
TE:
TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5
```

If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, then only transfer-coding is chunked. A message with no transfer-coding is always acceptable.

* **User-Agent**

The User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. Following is the general syntax:

```markdown
User-Agent : product | comment
```

Example:

```markdown
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

#### Server Response Headers

* **Accept-Ranges**

The Accept-Ranges response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Accept-Ranges  : range-unit | none
```

For example a server that accepts byte-range requests may send:

```markdown
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```

Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource may send:

```markdown
Accept-Ranges: none
```

This will advise the client not to attempt a range request.

* **Age**

The Age response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Age : delta-seconds
```

Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds. Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Age: 1030
```

An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache must include an Age header field in every response generated from its own cache.

* **ETag**

The ETag response-header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. The general syntax is:

```markdown
ETag :  entity-tag
```

Here are some simple examples:

```markdown
ETag: "xyzzy"
ETag: W/"xyzzy"
ETag: ""
```

* **Location**

The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Location : absoluteURI
```

Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Location: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
```

The Content-Location header field differs from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original location of the entity enclosed in the request.

* **Proxy-Authenticate**

The Proxy-Authenticate response-header field must be included as a part of a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Proxy-Authenticate  : challenge
```

* **Retry-After**

The Retry-After response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Retry-After : HTTP-date | delta-seconds
```

Examples:

```markdown
Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Retry-After: 120
```

In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.

* **Server**

The Server response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Server : product | comment
```

Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
```

If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must not modify the Server response-header.

* **Set-Cookie**

The Set-Cookie response-header field contains a name/value pair of information to retain for this URL. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; OPTIONS
```

#### Entity Headers

* **Allow**

The Allow entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Allow : Method
```

You can specify multiple methods separated by commas. Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT
```

This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.

* **Content-Encoding**

The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Content-Encoding : content-coding
```

The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by the Request-URI. Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not acceptable to the origin server, the server should respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).

* **Content-Language**

The Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Following is the general syntax:

```markdown
Content-Language : language-tag
```

Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Content-Language: mi, en
```

The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.

* **Content-Length**

The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent, had the request been a GET. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Content-Length : DIGITS
```

Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Content-Length: 3495
```

Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.

* **Content-Location**

The Content-Location entity-header field may be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Content-Location:  absoluteURI | relativeURI 
```
Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Content-Location: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
```

The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the entity.

* **Content-MD5**

The Content-MD5 entity-header field may be used to supply an MD5 digest of the entity for checking the integrity of the message upon receipt. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Content-MD5  : md5-digest using base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864
```

Following is a simple example:

```markdown
Content-MD5  : 8c2d46911f3f5a326455f0ed7a8ed3b3
```

The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body.

* **Content-Range**

The Content-Range entity-header field is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Content-Range : bytes-unit SP first-byte-pos "-" last-byte-pos
```

Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity contains a total of 1234 bytes:

```markdown
- The first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 0-499/1234

- The second 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-999/1234

- All except for the first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-1233/1234

- The last 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 734-1233/1234
```

When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range, this content is transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
Content-Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022
Content-Length: 26012
Content-Type: image/gif
```

* **Content-Type**

The Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent, had the request been a GET. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Content-Type : media-type
```

Following is an example:

```markdown
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4
```

* **Expires**
The Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Expires : HTTP-date
```

Following is an example:

```markdown
Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT
```

* **Last-Modified**

The Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified. The general syntax is:

```markdown
Last-Modified: HTTP-date
```

Following is an example:

```markdown
Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT
```

## HTTP Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data that is issued by a server in an HTTP response and stored for future use by the HTTP client. The client then re-supplies the cookie value in subsequent requests to the same server. This mechanism allows the server to store user preferences and identity individual users.

* [**Setting Cookies**](#setting-cookies)
* [**Retrieving Cookies**](#retrieving-cookies)

#### Setting Cookies

Servers supply cookies by populating the set-cookie response header with the following details:

| **_Name_** | **_Name of the cookie_**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value      | Textual value to be held by the cookie                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Expires    | Date/time when the cookie should be discarded by the browser. If this field is empty the cookie expires at the end of the current browser session. This field can also be used to delete a cookie by setting a date/time in the past. |
| Path       | Path below which the cookie should be supplied by the browser.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Domain     | Web site domain to which this cookie applies. This will default to the current domain and attempts to set cookies on other domains are subject to the privacy controls built into the browser.                                        |

These fields allow a server to create, modify, delete, and control which parts of a web site will receive the cookie.

#### Retrieving Cookies

Whenever a client is about to make an HTTP request it consults its local cookie store to see if any unexpired cookies match the path and domain it is about to use. Any matching cookie values are submitted back to the server using the cookie header.

Example:

```markdown
The following cookies were sent to the page:

Name  _ga

Value  GA1.2.1603568968.1681366048
```

## HTTP Caching

HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where performance can be improved by the use of response caches. The HTTP/1.1 protocol includes a number of elements intended to make caching work.

The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to eliminate the need to send requests in many cases, and to eliminate the need to send full responses in many other cases.

The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP/1.1 are implicit directives to caches where server-specifies expiration times and validators. We use the Cache-Control header for this purpose.

The Cache-Control header allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either requests or responses. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:

```markdown
Cache-control: no-cache
```

The following cache request directives can be used by the client in its HTTP request:

| **_Cache Request Directive_** | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no-cache                      | A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server.                                             |
| no-store                      | The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.                                                                                      |
| max-age = seconds             | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.                                                |
| max-stale [ = seconds ]       | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time. If seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time. |
| min-fresh = seconds           | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is not less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.               |
| no-transform                  | Does not convert the entity-body.                                                                                                                                     |
| only-if-cached                | Does not retrieve new data. The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.         |

The following cache response directives can be used by the server in its HTTP response

| **_Cache Response Directive_** | **_Description_**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public                         | Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.                                                                                                                                             |
| private                        | Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache.                                                                          |
| no-cache                       | A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful re-validation with the origin server.                                                                          |
| no-store                       | The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.                                                                                                                    |
| no-transform                   | Does not convert the entity-body.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| must-revalidate                | The cache must verify the status of stale documents before using it and expired ones should not be used.                                                                                            |
| proxy-revalidate               | The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.                                               |
| max-age = seconds              | Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.                                                                              |
| s-maxage = seconds             | The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache. |


## HTTP Cache vs HTTP Cookies

| Parameters          | Http Cache                                                                                                             | Http Cookies                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basics              | A system uses caches for storing content from a website and applications. They make things more accessible for a user. | A website or application uses cookies to store the user’s activities and identify their trail of preferences.                                                                                |
| Things Stored       | Cache stores Javascript, CSS, HTML pages, media (images and videos), etc.                                              | Cookies store temporary data for tracking, such as browsing sessions, history of using websites and apps, etc.                                                                               |
| Capacity            | Caches are comparatively less memory efficient. They occupy a lot of space on any device.                              | Cookies are far more efficient with the device’s memory. They take up a very lesser amount of memory.                                                                                        |
| Location of Storage | The cache stores the website content only on a user browser.                                                           | Cookies store their content on both- a server as well as a browser.                                                                                                                          |
| Expiration          | One needs to delete the cache manually. It does not expire automatically.                                              | The cookies have a very limited life span that depends entirely on their creators. The cookies, thus, expire after a fixed amount of time.                                                   |
| Sent with a Request | Sending a response in the form of cache does not come as a request to a user.                                          | Cookies pop up as a request in front of the users as a form of authorization/permission from them. In other words, it only sends a response to the servers with the end user’s confirmation. |

## HTTP URL Encoding

HTTP URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set, which often contain characters outside the ASCII set. So these unsafe characters must be replaced with a % followed by two hexadecimal digits.

The following table shows the ASCII symbols of the characters and their replacements which can be used in the URL before passing it to the server:

<!-- data-transpose data-type="none" -->
| **_ASCII_** | **_Symbol_** |                              **_Replacement_**                               |

|    < 32     |              | Encode with %xx where xx is the hexadecimal representation of the character. |

## HTTP Security

HTTP is used for communications over the internet, so application developers, information providers, and users should be aware of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1. This discussion does not include definitive solutions to the problems mentioned here but it does make some suggestions for reducing security risks.

* [**Personal Information Leakage**](#personal-information-leakage)
* [**File and Path Names Based Attack**](#file-and-path-names-based-attack)
* [**DNS Spoofing**](#dns-spoofing)
* [**Location Headers and Spoofing**](#location-headers-and-spoofing)
* [**Authentication Credentials**](#authentication-credentials)
* [**Proxies and Caching**](#proxies-and-caching)

#### Personal Information Leakage

HTTP clients are often privy to large amount of personal information such as the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption keys, etc. So you should be very careful to prevent unintentional leakage of this information via the HTTP protocol to other sources.

* All the confidential information should be stored at the server in encrypted form.
* Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software that is known to contain security holes.
* Proxies that serve as a portal through a network firewall should take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information that identifies the hosts behind the firewall.
* The information sent in the 'From' field might conflict with the user's privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence, it should not be transmitted without the user being able to disable, enable, and modify the contents of the field.
* Clients should not include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request, if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol.
* Authors of services that use the HTTP protocol should not use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because it will cause the data to be encoded in the Request-URI.

#### File and Path Names Based Attack

The document should be restricted to the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were intended by the server administrators.

For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems use '..' as a path component to indicate a directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP server MUST disallow any such construct in the Request-URI, if it would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP server.

#### DNS Spoofing

Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. So clients need to be cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name association.

If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to achieve a performance improvement, they must observe the TTL information reported by the DNS. If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when a previously-accessed server's IP address changes.

#### Location Headers and Spoofing

If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust one another, then it MUST check the values of Location and Content Location headers in the responses that are generated under the control of said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to invalidate resources over which they have no authority.

#### Authentication Credentials

Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1 does not provide a method for a server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials which is a big security risk.

There are a number of work around to the parts of this problem, and so it is recommended to make the use of password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other methods that mitigate the security problems inherent in this problem.

#### Proxies and Caching

HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Proxies have access to security-related information, personal information about individual users and organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and content providers.

Proxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run, as they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive information.

Caching proxies provide additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation. Therefore, cache contents should be protected as sensitive information.

## HTTP Examples

**Example 1**

HTTP request to fetch hello.htm page from the web server

Client request

```markdown
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

Server response

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<html>
   <body>

   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

   </body>
</html>
```

**Example 2**

HTTP request to fetch t.html page that does not exist on the web server.

Client request

```markdown
GET /t.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

Server response

```markdown
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2012 10:36:20 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-Length: 230
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
Connection: Closed
```

```htm
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html>

<head>
   <title>404 Not Found</title>
</head>

<body>
   <h1>Not Found</h1>
   <p>The requested URL /t.html was not found on this server.</p>
</body>

</html>
```
